\begin{letter}{
To: Economics Professors\\
Calhoun Hall \\
Vanderbilt University Econ Dept}

\opening{
Dear Colleagues,
}


Good news! I have managed to create a LaTeX package reproducing Vanderbilt
Department of Economics's letterhead. It works under the LaTeX standard
letter style. The only difference with the layout of the official letterhead
is the addition of the words "Department of Economics" to the department
address in the footer.

I haven't tested all the combinations of options, please let me know if anything doesn't
work as expected at my email andrea.moro@vanderbilt.edu. 

The package distribution contains 5
files: vandyletter.sty, cas04a.pdf, cas04acolor.pdf, vandyletter.tex and
vandyletter.pdf. The first three files are necessary. File vandyletter.tex
is this document, which you can use as a template, and vandyletter.pdf its
pdf version. \bigskip

\textbf{Style options}

The package comes with the following options (see below how to set the
options in Scientific Word)/ The default produces a color logo with address on the left.

\textbf{[no-logo]} for printing on pre-printed letterhead\vspace{.8ex} \newline 
\textbf{[addressright]} places your address to the right\vspace{.8ex} \newline 
\textbf{[color-logo]} prints vb's logo with the standard gold-v acorn \vspace{.8ex} \newline 
\textbf{[bw-logo]} prints vb's logo in black\vspace{.8ex} \newline 
\textbf{[britdate]} prints date as day-month-year\vspace{.8ex} \newline 
\textbf{[usesignature]} places the signature picture signature.jpg before your name
at the end (you need to create and place this file in the same directory
where your document is)\vspace{.8ex} \newline 
\textbf{[nofoot]} doesn't print the department's address in the footer of the first
page (all pages except the first will print a page number) \vspace{.8ex} \newline 
\textbf{[printenvelope]}
prints the address for an envelope \vspace{.8ex} \newline 
\textbf{[printlabel]} prints the address on a separate page \vspace{.8ex} \newline 


In the preamble of your file, you can specify the following:\newline
\newline
\texttt{\textbackslash name\{Sender's name\}} (required) \newline
\texttt{\textbackslash telephone\{phone number\}} \newline
\texttt{\textbackslash email\{email address\}}\newline
\texttt{\textbackslash address\{address row 1 \textbackslash \textbackslash 
address row 2 \textbackslash \textbackslash  address row 3\}}

The declaration \textbackslash address, if present, supercedes 
\textbackslash \textbackslash name \textbackslash \textbackslash 
\\telephone \textbackslash \textbackslash email and can be used to change the
default to any content you like.\bigskip




Enjoy! -- Andrea

\closing{
Sincerely,
}
